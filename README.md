# DATASCI 266 Final Project - Fall 2023

This repository contains the final submission files for the DATASCI 266 Final Project of Fall 2023. The project focuses on "Hate Speech Classification Using Albert."

## Team Members
- Cynthia Rosales
- Emiliano "Neal" Vazquez

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a model for the classification of hate speech using the ALBERT (A Lite BERT) algorithm. We aim to contribute to the field of natural language processing by addressing the critical issue of hate speech detection in digital communication.

## Repository Structure
- `Hate_Speech_Classification_Albert.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and analysis of our project.
- `Hate_Speech_Classification_Albert.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
To view the project report, open the `Hate_Speech_Classification_Albert.pdf` file. For the code, you can run the Jupyter Notebook `Hate_Speech_Classification_Albert.ipynb` in an environment that supports Python and the necessary libraries detailed within.
